            <p>The sheer number of AWS services within its ecosystem is a lot to absorb in one go. Especially if you
                have not worked with the tools directly. I created this table as a summary of services for all the
                services as of today</p>

                        <i>More on block storage: Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a
                            technology that is used to store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or cloud-based
                            storage environments. Developers favor block storage for computing situations where they
                            require
                            fast, efficient, and reliable data transportation.
                            Block storage breaks up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces,
                            each
                            with a unique identifier. The SAN places those blocks of data wherever it is most efficient.
                            That means it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be
                            configured
                            (or partitioned) to work with different operating systems. <a

                        Here's the difference between EBS (SAN) vs EFS (NAS). SAN's is a cloud of multiple storage
                        devices where blocks of data stored. NAS' are a single storage device that can be access across
                        a network.
