            <p>The sheer number of AWS services within its ecosystem is a lot to absorb in one go. Especially if you
                have not worked with the tools directly. I created this table as a summary of services for all the
                services as of today</p>

                        This is not a great option if retrieval performance is required in an application. As a
                        developer you can create life-cycle rules to move S3 objects to Glacier. This is the cheapest of
                        the storage services.</td>

                    <td>This is a low-latency, highly available, block-type storage. It is purpose is to connect to EC2
                        compute servers.

                        More on block storage: Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a
                        technology that is used to store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or cloud-based
                        storage environments. Developers favor block storage for computing situations where they require
                        fast, efficient, and reliable data transportation.
                        Block storage breaks up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces, each
                        with a unique identifier. The SAN places those blocks of data wherever it is most efficient.
                        That means it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be configured
                        (or partitioned) to work with different operating systems. <a

                    <td>Elastic File System (EFS)</td>
                    <td>This is a network-attached storage (NAS). Meaning that multiple servers can connect to the same
                        data source. NAS' are storage devices that can be access by multiple devices. There is usually
                        some target drive like E:// or F://
                        <hr>
                        Here's the difference between EBS (SAN) vs EFS (NAS). SAN's is a cloud of multiple storage
                        devices where blocks of data stored. NAS' are a single storage device that can be access across
                        a network.
