            <h3>AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification</h3>
            <p>While I was studying for my AWS CPC certification, the sheer number of AWS services within its ecosystem
                is difficult to absorb in one go. Below is a summary of all of the AWS services. Along with this,
                I'll provide some clarification on the subjects that I had trouble with too. Take note, I may mention an
                AWS service more than once because it serves mutliple services and AWS services work in conjunction with
                each other.</p>

            <p>Credit goes to BackSpace Academy's Udemy course for making all of this easier to learn, <a

            <div class='table-content'>
                <p>A special section has been carved out for AWS' CLI services. AWS' API that enables us to use the CLI.
                    The
                    API
                    enables
                    us to communicate with from a remote server to the AWS services in the AWS cloud (all tracked in
                    CloudTrail).</p>
                <p>
                    The Management Console makes HTTP requests to the AWS backend. Same for when we use CLI, it makes
                    HTTP
                    requests.
                    Wrapped around this API are different SDK’s. These are turned into libraries that can be used with
                    different
                    coding languages. All of API calls need to be auth’d by username and password.

                                    security where everything is a threat and so we should secure the cloud at all
                                    levels.

                                            resources (which) in the IAM policies. Policies can be broken down by
                                            identity-based (IAM users, groups) and resource-based (S3, KMS, and SES
                                            only). There are more types of policies but these are the main ones
                                            discussed.</li>
                                        <li>Network Security - defense in depth approach is taken where security of the
                                            network is taken at all levels internally and externally. Network level
                                            security - VPC (subnets, route tables, and Internet Gateway - component that
                                            allows communication between internal resources inside the VPC and the
                                            internet). Included here are ALB's and the WAF. ALB's can act like a proxy
                                            service that handles internet-facing traffic and cuts off direct connections
                                            from public access. Resource level security - use security groups to create
                                            virtual firewalls to enforce ingress and egress of traffic for resources.
                                            Security groups can be applied to EC2 instances, RDS and Lambda.</li>
                                        <li>Data encryption - data encryption is applied in transit and at rest. In
                                            transit is when data is passing between systems (HTTPS). At rest are within
                                            systems through the use of AWS Key Management Service (KMS).</li>

                                    recovery planning and adapting to changes.

                                        <li>Fault Isolation - isolate issues through the use of redundant, independent
                                            components through the use of fault isolation zones. This can be applied
                                            through:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Resource and Request - partitioning of resources and requests into
                                                    cells that are independent of each other. It can be partitioned by
                                                    dimensions like resource ID's. Shuffle sharding is applied here.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>AZ - independent data centers that contain redundant deployments of
                                                    your services across AZ's.</li>
                                                <li>Region - This is most isolated of all. It's a completely autonomous
                                                    data center. Redundant copies of your services are deployed across
                                                    regions. Regions has more overhead when redundant because there is

                                technology that is used to store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or
                                cloud-based
                                storage environments. Developers favor block storage for computing situations where they

                                fast, efficient, and reliable data transportation.
                                Block storage breaks up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate
                                pieces,
                                each
                                with a unique identifier. The SAN places those blocks of data wherever it is most
                                efficient.
                                That means it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be
