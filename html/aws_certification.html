            <!-- <p id="funStat"></p> -->
            <p>While I was studying for my AWS CPC certification, the sheer number of AWS services within its ecosystem
                is difficult to absorb in one go. Below is a summary of all of the AWS services. Along with this,
                I'll provide some clarification on the subjects that I had trouble with too.</p>

            <p>Credit goes to BackSpace Academy's Udemy course for making all of this easier to learn.  https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-associate-architect-developer-sysops-admin/learn/lecture/7020884</p>

                        <i>More on block storage: Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a
                            technology that is used to store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or cloud-based
                            storage environments. Developers favor block storage for computing situations where they
                            require
                            fast, efficient, and reliable data transportation.
                            Block storage breaks up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces,
                            each
                            with a unique identifier. The SAN places those blocks of data wherever it is most efficient.
                            That means it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be
                            configured
                            (or partitioned) to work with different operating systems. <a

                        a network.

            <li>Business agility - AWS allows an organization more time to innovate and reduce the time to go-to-market
                with these innovations.</li>
        </ol>
